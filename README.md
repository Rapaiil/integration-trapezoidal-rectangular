# C code for Evaluation of Definite Integrals using Rectangular and Trapezoidal Methods (Midpoint only)
## Users may be able to input the function "f(x)" assuming:
1) Function does not contain n-roots (e.g. square root)
2) Parenthesis "()" is used to disclose grouped operands and operators IF NEEDED
3) Divisor is not 0
4) Function does not require other integration techniques to evaluate (e.g. integration by parts, u-substitution, etc.)
5) Unknown variable is strictly "x" (e.g. 5x-2)
